	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how much time an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input increases. It helps us understand whether a solution is practical for large problems or only works for small ones. Choosing algorithms with better time complexity makes programs more efficient, because they can handle bigger inputs faster and with fewer resources.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run, depending on the input size. It includes memory for variables, data structures, and function calls. For example, if an algorithm uses memory directly proportional to the number of inputs, its space complexity is written as O(n). This helps us analyze whether a program is memory-friendly or may consume too much space for larger inputs.</p>
